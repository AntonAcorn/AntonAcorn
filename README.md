ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Anton and I am starving to be a Java Developer

ðŸ‘€Graduated from the courses of a Quality Engineer. 
But I decided to go further and start to learn coding. 
I finished Java courses and continue to improve myself everyday.

Here I have several repositories, where I share my experience using Java.
Try to use my pet projects:
