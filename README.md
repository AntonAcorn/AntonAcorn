👋 Hi, my name is Anton

Here I have several repositories, where I share my experience using Java.
Try to use my pet projects:

✨https://github.com/AntonAcorn/TelegramFileHosting
This is a Telegram bot project wrapped into Docker. In the README file, it is described how to use it

✨ https://github.com/AntonAcorn/MyLibrary. 
This is a Library application

✨https://github.com/AntonAcorn/URLShortener
This is a simple URL Shortener. Using only API

✨https://github.com/AntonAcorn/SensorRestServer
This is an API service in which you can add sensor and read its measurments

✨https://github.com/AntonAcorn/MyLibraryCRUDApp
This is the same as Library Application, but uses JDBC Template

Tasks repository is about solving small syntax tasks and studying JavaCore.
The other repositories mostly are about Spring framework and I keep just for myself in case to refresh some information
